# Images, Pixels, Canvas, Tigers and Bears... Code Examples

Here are the code examples I showed in a presentation about the joy of using canvas to manipulate images.

The code is heavily documented (the JS files are the most interesting ones) and you can also check the [slides of the presentation](https://noti.st/codepo8/qgPot7) to get more context. 

If you want to try these out in the browser right now, check out the [Code examples](https://codepo8.github.io/programmed-in-pencil-canvas-presentation/index.html) in your browser of choice right now.

cheers

Chris
